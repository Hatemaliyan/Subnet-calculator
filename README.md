# Subnet Calculator

This is a Python program that calculates and prints information about a subnet based on user input. 

It uses the re library to validate user input and the SubnetCalculator class to perform subnet calculations.

# Usage

To use the program, run the calculate_subnet() function. The function will prompt the user to enter an IP address, a subnet mask in CIDR notation (optional), and whether to partition by number of hosts or number of subnets. 

The user will also be prompted to enter a number of hosts or subnets, depending on their choice of partitioning type.

 **The program will then calculate and print the following information about the subnet**:

Subnet mask (in mask decimal format)
Subnet in CIDR
Number of hosts
Number of subnets
Network address
Broadcast address

# Dependencies

The program requires the re library, which is part of the Python standard library and does not require any additional installation or setup.
